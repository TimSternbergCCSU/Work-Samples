four main memory accesses with each access requiring 1 microsecond
two disk file accesses with each requiring 1 millisecond
total: 2.004 milliseconds per second

big o efficiency of O( N * Log(N^2))
This means there is NLog(N^2) statements
1000 * Log(1000^2) * 2.004 milliseconds = 12024 milliseconds


if N = 1000 and each statement requires 2.004 milliseconds, then the construct would take 12024 milliseconds to execute
