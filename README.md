# Tim Sternberg Work Samples

These are most of my projects throughout my college career, as well as some side projects. Any of the LUA code I did on my own time, and was probably my favorite. The most fun I had with coding projects in school was the Honey Encryption for Computer Security, and the Fingerprint Sensor for Systems Programming. Those two projects I put a lot of work into, and I was really happy with the results.

The Honey Encryption was a pretty cool project, since I started with basically no knowledge as to what it was. I started out with Python code, and converted it to C code. By doing this, I essentially learned every aspect of what Honey Encryption is, how it works, and what the potential problems are with it. I came up with a ton of ideas as to how it could be improved and I hope one day I can start working on it again to see what I can do.

I've been coding since I was 11 years old, and I absolutely fell in love with it. It's been something that I've always had to plug my creativity into, and I have so much fun putting things from my brain into something that other people can see, share, and hopefully enjoy as well.
