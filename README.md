# Tim About Me | Projects

I've been coding since I was in middle school, and I absolutely fell in love with it. It's been something that I've always had to plug my creativity into, and I have so much fun putting things from my brain into something that other people can see, share, and hopefully enjoy as well.

These are most of my projects throughout my college career, as well as some side projects. Any of the LUA code I did on my own time, and was probably my favorite. The most fun I had with coding projects in school was the Honey Encryption for Computer Security, and the Fingerprint Sensor for Systems Programming. Those two projects I put a lot of work into, and I was really happy with the results.

Some of the specialized classes I've taken or are taking as of the fall of 2018 are Computer Security, Artificial Intelligence, Design Patterns, and an Independent Study on AI.

The Honey Encryption was a really cool project, since I started with basically no knowledge as to what it was. I started out with Python code, and converted it to C code. By doing this, I essentially learned every aspect of what Honey Encryption is, how it works, and what the potential problems are with it. I came up with a ton of ideas as to how it could be improved and I hope one day I can start working on it again to see what I can do.

I did a research project in AI the spring of 2018 which I had a lot of fun with. The subject I chose for it was Artificial Neural Networks, and is currently what I'm focusing on for an Independent Study i'm taking for the fall of 2018. I'm building an artificial neural network and having it solve Anomoly Detection problems within virus protection programs. Artificial Intelligence is my favorite field of study within Computer Science by far.
